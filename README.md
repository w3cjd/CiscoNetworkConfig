# Computer Networking Final Project: Network Configuration

Scope: Set up corporate network and implement security settings for a new bank branch.

COMPLETED TASKS:
- Devised network topology plan and subnets.
- Built VLANs, trunks, and routing to allow communication across entire network between branches. Arranged switches to implement port security and routers to work with OSPF.
- Configured network devices to prevent unauthorized access by securing privilege mode, encrypting passwords and designing security messaging. Conducted a successful connectivity test, including remote access to network devices.

Utilized Cisco Packet Tracer.

Project steps and configurations are fully documented in the report. Packet Tracer file of the final configuration and scenario is also attached.

This course was part of my studies in the Cybersecurity Professional Bootcamp at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
